# Apple Home with ESP32 and Swift

# Overview

This project demonstrates how to use Swift to control an ESP32 microcontroller, which is connected to an Apple HomeKit environment. 

The ESP32 acts as a bridge between the Swift application and the Apple Home ecosystem, allowing for seamless integration of IoT devices.

# Building the Project
